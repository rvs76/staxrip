How can I encode with a fixed bitrate?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the video encoder config dialog go to the Basic tab and choose a fixed bitrate mode like 2 pass.

At the bottom of the video encoder config dialog there is a drop down menu where a profile can be saved.


How can I batch encode with a fixed bitrate?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

StaxRip remembers if the file size or bitrate was edited last so if you edit the bitrate last it will encode using a fixed bitrate.


Why is encoding with 2 pass using a fixed bitrate not recommended?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sources can vary greatly in complexity depending on the nature of the source, there still might be situations where fixed bitrates are useful.


Why don't settings persist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

StaxRip loads a default template on startup, templates can be saved with:

Main Menu > Project > Save As Template

Project options are per Template/Project/Job and settings are global.


How can I use custom AviSynth plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom plugins can either be loaded manually using LoadPlugin():

http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Plugins

Or they can be loaded automatically using the plugin auto load folder.

This folder can be opened in StaxRip with:

Main Menu > Tools > Folders > Plugins

StaxRip is only available for x64 and therefore only x64 plugins can be used.

The AviSynth script can be edited manually using the code editor (Filters > Edit Code) or the filters menu can be configured using the filter profile editor (Filters > Profiles).


How can I use custom AviSynth scripts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom scripts can either be loaded manually using Import():

http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Import

Or they can be loaded automatically using the plugin auto load folder.

This folder can be opened in StaxRip with:

Main Menu > Tools > Folders > Plugins

The AviSynth script can be edited manually using the code editor (Filters > Edit Code) or the filters menu can be configured using the filter profile editor (Filters > Profiles).

Is there a way to make StaxRip fully Portable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes and No, Due to VFW framework  requires registery keys and registery keys must point to AVS+ or VS/Python locations. Which requires editing the registery keys at multiple locations. It's easier just to install the Frameservers and allow the installers to create the proper keys for global acess instead of just local acess.
