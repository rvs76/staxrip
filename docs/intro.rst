Setup
-----

StaxRip is for the most part portable, some features require certain apps to be installed, in such case StaxRip provides guidance so the user must not take great care. This is due to VFW Framework. 

Whenever StaxRip starts the first time from a new location it will ask for a settings folder location to use for this particular start-up location. You can open the current settings folder from the main menu at Tools > Folders > Settings

It's not recommended to start StaxRip from a location without full write access so 'C:\\Program Files' shouldn't be used. StaxRip utilizes dozens of tools and some of this tools might require write access to their start-up directory.

To add StaxRip to the windows start menu right-click the StaxRip.exe and choose *Add to Start*.
