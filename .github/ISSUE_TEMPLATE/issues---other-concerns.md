**Notes Before Posting**
- Only Open an issue if it's tied to Staxrip, If issues is tied to external program or filter. Head to Resp page for that project and open an issue there. 
- Beta Releases are Not Covered, Beta Are Pre-Releases and Could Contain Bugs. This is the Risk Your Willing to Take When using Beta releases. Beta Concerns should be posted in the forums.
- If you Require Help with one of the FrameServers, Programs or Scripting Post in the Forums, Rather then opening a ticket here.

- Check your CPU Specs as Well. Many newer Filters are AVX2 Enabled with no AVX1 support(This is espeically True on VapourSynth side. Which will crash the software if your CPU doesn't support it.
- Lastly, Only Files that are Released with StaxRip are fully supported, This is done to make debugging easier. Also since all filters have been tested before release. Newer versions can have changes which have not been added to StaxRip yet.
